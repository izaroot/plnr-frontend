Hi there,
    This was the app that was going to be everything for us. Sadly, we were robbed blind by our arrogant ambitions.

This is an app that will track scheduled tasks for users. Users can log in, or create a new user account. Users can add tasks, and see them in order, separated by week, and day. Users can mark a task as complete, can delete a task altogether, or edit the details of a task. A counter will mirror the amount of tasks that the user has completed. Tasks are pre-defined, and in the future could be expanded manually, or we can implemnent a process in which users can submit new tasks to our database.

Tasks are pre-defined so we can provide data-analysis as to which tasks are: most popular for all-time; most popular by the hour, most popular by the day, by the week, etc...

We used Semantics-UI and React
